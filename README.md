A python interpreter written in Ocaml

This work was originally done as our big group project at Cornell for CS3110. We did pretty well for knowing nothing about interpreters but some of our design decisions could have been better. My goal with this is to fix some of the issues we had with our original design and to expand it to a larger subsection of python features.
